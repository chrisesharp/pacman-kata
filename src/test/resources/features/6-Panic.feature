Feature: effects of power pills on ghosts
  As a ghost
  I can effect the appropriate behaviour based on panic levels
  So that I can respond correctly to a power pill being eaten by pacman

Scenario: pacman catches half-speed ghost when panicked
Given the game state is
"""

When we parse the state
And we play 1 turn
And we render the game
Then the game screen is
"""
