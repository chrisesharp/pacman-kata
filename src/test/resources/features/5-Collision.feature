Feature: Pacman and Ghost collision
  As a game engine
  I can compute the effect of collision between moveable game elements
  So that those elements will behave correctly as per the rules

Scenario: ghost catches pacman
Given the game state is
"""
3    0
+----+
|>  M|
+----+
"""
When we parse the state
And we play 3 turns
And we render the game
Then the game screen should be
"""
2    0
+----+
|*   |
+----+
"""

Scenario: ghost catches pacman with 1 life left
Given the game state is
"""
1    0
+----+
|>  M|
